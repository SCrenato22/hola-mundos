The reggae band Laguna Pai begins to take its more than ten years of experience beyond its native Peru and, as part of an international tour, they will arrive this week in Argentina and for the first time in Mar del Plata: they will perform this Saturday in BrewHouse Cultural City with local bands.

As part of a tour of South America, the Andeans will arrive this Saturday night at the BrewHouse Cultural City at Garibaldi 4830. And to get tickets that start at $20,000, it is necessary to purchase them through the Passline system.This intense international tour called “Visions” will take them to Santiago de Chile on Friday, that is, the day before their presentation in Mar del Plata where they will share the stage with the local band Panal Reggae, Rama Santana and Reggae Brothers.

In addition, Laguna Pai will close the month with two presentations at La Trastienda in the City of Buenos Aires and on October 31 they will perform in La Plata with one of the main bands of the genre in Argentina: Nonpalidece. Then, on November 3 they will close the tour in Montevideo.

In their more than ten years of history they have released six albums: “Kultura Babylon” (2010), “Atento” (2013), “Resiliencia” (2015), “Resiliencia Dubs” (2017), “Impulso Eterno” (2020) and “The Road is Long, Vol. 1” (2022). However, after that last studio album they released EPs and multiple singles: this year they released “Mi Gente.”
